        Encodes a list of strings into a single string using a length-prefix format.

        Approach:
        The core idea is to create a format that is reversible and can handle any
        character, including special delimiters. We achieve this by prepending each 
        string with its length, followed by a '#' separator.
        
        Example:
        ["hello", "world"] -> "5#hello5#world"
        ["a#b", "c"] -> "3#a#b1#c"

        Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of characters across all strings in the list.
        Space Complexity: O(N), to store the resulting encoded string.

        for s in strs:
            # For each string, create a chunk in the format "[length]#[string]".
            # This format ensures we know exactly how many characters to read for each string
            # during decoding, even if the string itself contains the '#' delimiter.
            res += str(len(s)) + '#' + s

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        """
        Decodes a single string (encoded with the length-prefix format) back into a list of strings.

        Approach:
        The method iterates through the encoded string, parsing it chunk by chunk.
        In each chunk, it first reads the number before the '#' to determine the
        length of the upcoming string, then extracts that many characters.

        Example:
        "5#hello5#world" -> ["hello", "world"]
        "3#a#b1#c" -> ["a#b", "c"]
        
        Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the encoded string.
        Space Complexity: O(K), where K is the number of strings in the output list.
