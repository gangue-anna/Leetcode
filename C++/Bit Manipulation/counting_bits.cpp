     * Approach:
     * - Use DP to count the number of 1's in the binary representation for each number from 0 to n.
     * - For each i, find the largest power of two â‰¤ i (called offset).
     * - The number of 1's in i = 1 + number of 1's in (i - offset),
     *   because subtracting offset removes the most significant 1-bit from i.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     *   - We process each number from 1 to n once.
     *
     * Space Complexity: O(n)
     *   - We store the count of 1's for each number in a vector of size n+1.

ðŸ“– Line-by-line explanation for beginners:
-------------------------------------------
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
    â†’ Includes all standard C++ libraries.

using namespace std;
    â†’ So we donâ€™t have to prefix things like vector, cout with `std::`.

class Solution { â€¦ };
    â†’ Defines a class named Solution.

public:
    â†’ Marks the following members as publicly accessible.

vector<int> countBits(int n) { â€¦ }
    â†’ Function that takes an integer `n` and returns a vector<int> with the counts.

vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    â†’ Create a vector of size (n+1) initialized to 0, to store DP results.

int offset = 1;
    â†’ Initialize offset to 1, which is the smallest power of two.

for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) { â€¦ }
    â†’ Loop through numbers from 1 to n.

if (offset * 2 == i) offset = i;
    â†’ If we reach the next power of two (like 2, 4, 8â€¦), update offset.

dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset];
    â†’ DP relation: 
      number of 1â€™s in i = 1 + number of 1â€™s in (i - offset),
      because (i - offset) removes the highest set bit from i.

return dp;
    â†’ Return the DP array.

-------------------------------------------
ðŸ”· Why does it work?
- At each number i, we find the largest power of two â‰¤ i.
- Remove this highest bit and count the remaining bits (already computed in DP).
- Add 1 for the removed bit.

Example:
i = 5 (binary: 101), offset = 4
i - offset = 1 (binary: 001), DP[1] = 1
So DP[5] = 1 + DP[1] = 2

-------------------------------------------
Time Complexity: O(n) â†’ Loop runs n times.
Space Complexity: O(n) â†’ We store n+1 integers.
