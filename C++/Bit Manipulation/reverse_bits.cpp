     * - Iterate over all 32 bits of the input integer `n`.
     * - For each bit at position `i`, extract it and set it in position `31-i` in the result.
     * - Use bitwise shift and OR to construct the result.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(1)
     *   - Exactly 32 iterations regardless of input.

     * Space Complexity: O(1)
     *   - We use only two integers (`res` and `bit`).

ðŸ“– Line-by-line explanation for beginners:
------------------------------------------
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
    â†’ Includes all standard C++ libraries.

using namespace std;
    â†’ Avoids writing std:: before common objects like vector, cout, etc.

class Solution { â€¦ };
    â†’ Defines a class named Solution (as per LeetCode style).

public:
    â†’ Marks the following methods as accessible from outside the class.

uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) { â€¦ }
    â†’ Function that takes a 32-bit unsigned integer `n` and returns its bit-reversed value.

uint32_t res = 0;
    â†’ Initialize the result variable `res` to 0.

for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) { â€¦ }
    â†’ Loop through all 32 bits of the integer.

uint32_t bit = (n >> i) & 1;
    â†’ Shift `n` right by `i` to bring the i-th bit to the least significant position,
      then use `& 1` to extract just that bit.

res |= (bit << (31 - i));
    â†’ Shift `bit` to position `(31 - i)` (the mirror position) and OR it into `res`.

return res;
    â†’ Return the final reversed bits as an unsigned integer.

------------------------------------------
Time Complexity: O(1) â†’ 32 iterations.
Space Complexity: O(1) â†’ Only uses a few integer variables.
